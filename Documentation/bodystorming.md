06-May-2019 Bodystorming

We conducted some bodystorming with two of the members of the group. Both members where able to try simulating using 
the app on a regular android phone in order to generate ideas and come to realization about important functionalites
in the purpose of finding the best user experience.

The content of this bodystorming concluded making swedish meatballs with creamed macaroni. This means we would have to 
multitask with a timer while at the same time manage messy hands while preparing the food. The members took turns
while observing the task and managing the task and photos where taken as a reference.

With the bodystorming we concluded the following:
* It is important that the sensor can react with just an elbow or something else available since otherwise you will risk
dropping food or objects on your phone.
* Sometimes multiple timers are necassary, there has to be an easy way to navigate this in the app.
* The function for switching instructions in recipes hands-free is great.
* Need of an easy way to start a timer in recipe mode and also overviewing the timer at the same time, otherwise you won't
have a general clue of when the food is ready and can't prepare for an easy flow while cooking.
